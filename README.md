# Time-Series-Analysis

Automated Forecast Insights is a system that uses machine learning algorithms, specifically ARIMA and FbProphet, to analyze and predict future trends in a dataset. The system is designed to be user-friendly, requiring no coding knowledge to use. The system is particularly effective for analyzing and predicting trends in cryptocurrency-related data.

The system is built using Python programming language and Flask web framework. PowerBI is used for data visualization and reporting.

ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, which is a time-series analysis algorithm used for forecasting. FbProphet is a forecasting algorithm developed by Facebook that uses Bayesian regression to forecast time-series data.

In summary, Automated Forecast Insights is a powerful and easy-to-use system for analyzing and predicting trends in datasets, particularly for cryptocurrency-related data, using advanced machine learning algorithms.
